/**
    Macro to generate the appropriate methods and boilerplate for a singleton class.

    To use this, add the line GLUE_DECLARE_SINGLETON(MyClass, doNotRecreateAfterDeletion)
    to the class's definition.

    Then put a macro GLUE_IMPLEMENT_SINGLETON(MyClass) along with the class's
    implementation code.

    It's also a very good idea to also add the call clearSingletonInstance() in your class's
    destructor, in case it is deleted by other means than deleteInstance()

    Clients can then call the static method MyClass::getInstance() to get a pointer
    to the singleton, or MyClass::getInstanceWithoutCreating() which will return nullptr if
    no instance currently exists.

    e.g. @code

        struct MySingleton
        {
            MySingleton() {}

            ~MySingleton()
            {
                // this ensures that no dangling pointers are left when the
                // singleton is deleted.
                clearSingletonInstance();
            }

            GLUE_DECLARE_SINGLETON (MySingleton, false)
        };

        // ..and this goes in a suitable .cpp file:
        GLUE_IMPLEMENT_SINGLETON (MySingleton)


        // example of usage:
        auto* m = MySingleton::getInstance(); // creates the singleton if there isn't already one.

        ...

        MySingleton::deleteInstance(); // safely deletes the singleton (if it's been created).

    @endcode

    If doNotRecreateAfterDeletion = true, it won't allow the object to be created more
    than once during the process's lifetime - i.e. after you've created and deleted the
    object, getInstance() will refuse to create another one. This can be useful to stop
    objects being accidentally re-created during your app's shutdown code.

    If you know that your object will only be created and deleted by a single thread, you
    can use the slightly more efficient GLUE_DECLARE_SINGLETON_SINGLETHREADED macro instead
    of this one.

    This is exactly the same as GLUE_DECLARE_SINGLETON, but doesn't use a critical
