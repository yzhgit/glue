/**
 *  @brief
 *    Path to file or directory
 *
 *    This class stores a path to a file or directory and provides common
 *    operations like getting the file name or extension.
 *
 *    Path uses a unified format for storing paths that can be used
 *    consistently on every platform, using only '/' as a separator.
 *    When a Path is constructed from a string, the path is translated into
 *    the unified format and can then be used in a cross-platform way throughout
 *    an application. All operations on Path also return paths in the same
 *    unified format. To obtain a path in native platform format, use toNative().
 *
 *    All operations are completely string-based and don't use any system information.
 *    Therefore, paths are treated purely syntactically and do not imply that
 *    for example a file does really exist.
