        The file should already exist, and should already be the size that you want to work with
        when you call this. If the file is resized after being opened, the behaviour is undefined.

        If the file exists and the operation succeeds, the getData() and getSize() methods will
        return the location and size of the data that can be read or written. Note that the entire
        file is not read into memory immediately - the OS simply creates a virtual mapping, which
        will lazily pull the data into memory when blocks are accessed.

        If the file can't be opened for some reason, the getData() method will return a null
       pointer.

        NOTE: The start of the actual range used may be rounded-down to a multiple of the OS's
       page-size, so do not assume that the mapped memory will begin at exactly the position you
       requested.
