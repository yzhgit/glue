    Automatically unlocks and re-locks a mutex object.

    This is the reverse of a ScopedLock object - instead of locking the mutex
    for the lifetime of this object, it unlocks it.

    Make sure you don't try to unlock mutexes that aren't actually locked!

    e.g. @code

    Mutex mutex;

    for (;;)
    {
        const ScopedLock<Mutex> myScopedLock (mutex);
        // mutex is now locked

        ... do some stuff with it locked ..

        while (xyz)
        {
            ... do some stuff with it locked ..

            const ScopedUnlock<Mutex> unlocker (mutex);

            // mutex is now unlocked for the remainder of this block,
            // and re-locked at the end.

            ...do some stuff with it unlocked ...
        }

        // mutex gets unlocked here.
    }
